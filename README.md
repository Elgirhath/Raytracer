# Raytracer
Repository for my raytracer written with C++. the raytracer can calculate physically apropriate shadows and materials including:
* Diffuse shader using Phong's algorithm
* Glossy shader
* Transparent shader
* Glass shader with correct refraction

Shaders can be combined together creating realistic materials. The engine also supports the Fresnel effect. The models can be imported as .obj files. Engine also supports multiple light sources.

It is also very easy to create animations.
